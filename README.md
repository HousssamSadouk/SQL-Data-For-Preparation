# Forest-Fire-Prediction
Forest, bush or vegetation , can be described as any uncontrolled and non-prescribed combustion or burning of plants in a natural setting such as forest , grassland.we will not determining if a forest fire will take place or not , we are predicting the confidence of the forest fire based on some attributes.

so we start off with building a ML model using RandomForestRegression model and train that model using the dataset.For this project you will also see RandomSearchCV in action and how we have implemented it.
